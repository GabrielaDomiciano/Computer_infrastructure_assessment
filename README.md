### Overview

This project automates the process of downloading weather data from the [Met Eireann](https://data.gov.ie/dataset/todays-weather-athenry) and stores it in a timestamped format. The data is then pushed to a GitHub repository daily, utilizing GitHub Actions for automation.


### Project Structure üìÅ

data/  - Directory that contains the weather data and timestamps.

timestamps/ - Contains timestamped files.

weather/ - Contains weather data.

weather.sh - Bash script to download and store weather data.

weather.ipynb - Jupyter notebook summarizing the tasks and data analysis.

github/workflows/ - Contains the GitHub Actions workflow to automate the script


### How to Get Started üõ†Ô∏è

Follow these steps to get started with the Weather Data Automation Project:

- Clone the Repository with git clone.
- Open in VSCode, to open the project locally or Codespaces, to work directly in the browser.
- Make sure you have Python installed and run.
- Run the Scripts. Download the data manually with bash weather.sh and analyze the data by opening the jupyter notebook weather.ipynb.
- The project is already configured with GitHub Actions.

### Running the Project üíª

The project is automated using GitHub Actions. Data is downloaded every day at 10am and pushed to the repository.
