    "## Weather Data Analysis Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook documents the steps completed over the weeks to accomplish Tasks 1 through 7. The goal is to provide a clear summary of the progress and tools used in each task, serving as a reference for the weather data analysis project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, each Task will be briefly explained, with a description of the commands and methods applied to achieve its objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task Descriptions\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Task 01 - Creating Directories   \n",
    "Using the command line, I created a `data` directory at the root of the repository. Inside `data`, I added two subdirectories: `timestamps` and `weather`. First, I verified my location with `ls`, navigated to the parent directory using `cd ..`, and created the folders using `mkdir`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Task 02 - Recording Timestamps  \n",
    "\n",
    "I navigated to the `data/timestamps` directory and created a file named `now.txt`. Using the `date` command, I appended the current date and time to the file with the `>>` operator to ensure the content wasnâ€™t overwritten. The command used was:  \n",
    "`date +\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S\" >> now.txt`  \n",
    "I repeated this step ten times and verified the content of `now.txt` using the `more` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Task 03 - Formatting Timestamps\n",
    "I used the `date` command to format the current date and time in different ways and appended the results to `formatted.txt` without overwriting it. Then, I checked the file to ensure the dates were correctly added.\n",
    "1. **`20241119_211053`**: `YYYYmmdd_HHMMSS`  \n",
    "2. **`19-Nov-2024 21:21:47`**: `dd-MMM-yyyy HH:mm:ss`  \n",
    "3. **`11/19/2024 09:22:08 PM`**: `MM/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss AM/PM`  \n",
    "4. **`46 2024`**: `WW yyyy` (Week number and year)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Task 04 - Creating a File with a Timestamped Name\n",
    "I used the `touch` command with the `date` command embedded in backticks to create an empty file. The file name follows the format `YYYYmmdd_HHMMSS.txt`, based on the current date and time. The command I ran was: touch `date +\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S\"`.txt - file name 20241106_191122.txt.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Task 5 - Download Today's Weather Data\n",
    "I navigated to the `data/weather` directory and used the `wget` command to download the latest weather data for the Athenry weather station from Met Eireann. I used the `-O` option to save the data as `weather.json`. The data was retrieved from the following URL:https://prodapi.metweb.ie/observations/athenry/today\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Task 6 - Timestamp the Data\n",
    "I modified the previous command to save the downloaded weather data with a timestamped filename in the format `YYYYmmdd_HHMMSS_athenry.json`. To do this, I embedded the `date` command within the `wget` command to dynamically generate the filename based on the current date and time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Task 7 - Write the Script\n",
    "I created a bash script called `weather.sh` that automates the process of downloading weather data for Athenry. Here's what the script does:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prints the current date and time** using `date`.\n",
    "2. **Displays a message** saying \"downloading weather data\".\n",
    "3. **Downloads the weather data** using `wget`, saving the file in the `data/weather` directory with a timestamped filename in the format `YYYYmmdd_HHMMSS_athenry.json`.\n",
    "4. **Prints a message** confirming that the weather data was downloaded.\n",
    "5. **Prints the current date and time again** after the download is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Task 8 - Notebook called weather.ipynb\n",
    "The tasks 01 to 07 were completed by utilizing a combination of bash commands like cd, wget, date, and bash scripting. In the file weather.ipynb you can find a brief report explaining how all the tasks was  completed.\n"
