    "\n",
    "Below, each task is briefly explained, with a description of the commands and methods applied to achieve its objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 1: Creating Directories\n",
    "- Using the command line, I created a `data` directory at the root of the repository. Inside `data`, I added two subdirectories: `timestamps` and `weather`.\n",
    "- Verified my location with `ls`, navigated to the parent directory using `cd ..`, and created the folders using `mkdir`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 2: Recording Timestamps\n",
    "- Navigated to the `data/timestamps` directory and created a file named `now.txt`.\n",
    "- Used the `date` command to append the current date and time to the file without overwriting it. The command used:  \n",
    "  `date +\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S\" >> now.txt`  \n",
    "- Repeated this step more times and verified the content using the `more` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 3: Formatting Timestamps\n",
    "- Used the `date` command to format the current date and time in different styles and appended the results to `formatted.txt`. The formats used include:\n",
    "  1. `20241119_211053`: `YYYYmmdd_HHMMSS`\n",
    "  2. `19-Nov-2024 21:21:47`: `dd-MMM-yyyy HH:mm:ss`\n",
    "  3. `11/19/2024 09:22:08 PM`: `MM/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss AM/PM`\n",
    "  4. `46 2024`: `WW yyyy` (Week number and year)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 4: Creating a File with a Timestamped Name\n",
    "- Created an empty file using the `touch` command with the `date` command embedded to generate a timestamped filename.\n",
    "- Example command:  \n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  touch `date +\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S\"`.txt.\n"

    "## Automating Weather Data Collection with GitHub Actions\n",
    "\n",
    "I automated the `weather.sh` script to run daily and push new weather data to my GitHub repository using GitHub Actions. Below is a summary of the steps I completed:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Setting Up the GitHub Actions Workflow\n",
    "- I created a `.github/workflows/` directory in my repository and added a file named `weather-data.yml` to define the workflow, to create a directory in the terminal, use the mkdir command.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Scheduling the Workflow\n",
    "- Using the `schedule` event with a `cron` expression, I configured the workflow to run daily at 10 AM.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Specifying the Environment\n",
    "- I used a Linux-based Ubuntu virtual machine as the runtime environment for the workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Cloning the Repository\n",
    "- The workflow includes a step to clone the repository so that it has access to the `weather.sh` script and necessary files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Executing the Script\n",
    "- I added a step to execute the `weather.sh` script, which downloads and saves the latest weather data for Athenry.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Committing and Pushing Changes\n",
    "- The workflow is configured to commit the new weather data with a timestamped filename and push the changes back to the repository automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Testing the Workflow\n",
    "- After committing and pushing the workflow file to the repository, I tested it using the `workflow_dispatch` event.\n",
    "- I verified the logs in the Actions tab to ensure the script executed successfully, and the new weather data was correctly committed to the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "This automation ensures the weather data is collected daily without manual intervention, showcasing the power of GitHub Actions for workflow automation.\n"
